# GOOGLE !!!

Google is your best friend. Unless you're looking up the details of a specific command or file format, Google should be the first resource you consult for any question. **Make it a habit!!!**

# pwd command

# ls command

# mkdir command

# cd command

# mv command

# cp command 

# man command

The manual pages, usually called "man pages" because they are read with the man command. Man pages are typically installed with the system.

### man: read man pages

**man** *title* formats a specific manual page and sends it to your terminal.

* For example we use the man command for ls command

```
$ man ls
```

As a result you get a page with:

* Name of the command
* Synopsis of the command
* Description of the command

And some other optios that we will discuss later.
